With pay-per-feature requests
=============================

We strive to implement new features in Quasar, but our resources are limited. If you
require a feature urgently and are willing to finance it, we are ready to allocate extra
programming resources. 

As a recognition of your financial contribution, the newly implemented feature will 
be closed source (only for your use) for 6 months and will be open sourced after. Furthermore,
you will be referenced both in the source code and on the Quasar website as a contributor.
This way we can grow faster for the whole community!

Please send us a short description of your problem and we will get back to you with a quote.
