## I am having trouble installing Orange.

Make sure you are downloading the latest version. You can also try to download a standalone installer or Anaconda distribution.

Still no luck? Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/biolab/orange3/issues) for similar issues or report a new one.

## I am having trouble installing an add-on.

Make sure you are using the latest version of Orange. Encountering issues, please raise them on the relevant {{< link_new url="https://github.com/biolab?q=orange3-" name="add-on's issue tracker">}}. Alternatively, you can try with Anaconda distribution and install the add-on in the terminal. You can use pip or conda to install a package directly. E.g.:

	pip install orange3-text

	conda install orange3-timeseries

## I would like to learn how to use Orange. Where can I find the resources?
Widget documentation is available on our {{< link_new url="https://orange.biolab.si/toolbox/" name="website">}}. You can also access the same documentation directly from Orange by selecting the widget and pressing F1.

We also provide an e-mail course ( {{< link_new url="https://biolab.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=2cad1f1cbf3a532a77efe4354&amp;id=6f257f15ff" name="subscribe here">}}), beginner-level {{< link_new url="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvY-HrE0yv-8Fy" name="YouTube tutorials">}} and a regularly updated
{{< link_new url="https://blog.biolab.si/" name="blog">}}.

## I have a question concerning data mining, statistics and machine learning algorithms.
Visit {{< link_new url="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange" name="Data Science StackExchange">}} and ask the community!

## What data does Orange support?
Core Orange supports Excel, comma- and tab-delimited files (.xlsx, .csv, .tab). It also reads online data, such as Google Spreadsheets. Orange3-ImageAnalytics add-on can import images (.jpg, .tiff, .png). Orange3-Corpus add-on can import text files (.txt, .docx, .odt). SQL widget supports PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases.

## I want to use Orange on big data.
Orange provides the SQL widget, which samples data instances and enables exploratory data analysis on large datasets. You need {{< link_new url="http://initd.org/psycopg/" name="psycopg2">}} module installed to be able to see the widget. Install it directly in Python with 

	pip install psycopg2

command. You can also use {{< link_new url="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/2uda/" name="2UDA package">}} for easier installation. Please note that Orange supports only PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases for now.

## Can I export Orange workflow as a Python script?
Unfortunately, no. We've {{< link_new url="https://github.com/biolab/orange3/issues/1341" name="debated this long and hard">}}. A (limited) functionality of this type would probably be possible, but would be a very big project to do well and would cost more than the expected benefits.

## I wish to propose a collaboration and/or a project with the Orange team.
Please submit a contact request and we will respond as soon as we can.

## I wish to develop a widget / an add-on for Orange.
We are always happy to receive contributions! Development documentation for {{< link_new url="http://orange-development.readthedocs.io/" name="widgets">}} and {{< link_new url="https://github.com/biolab/orange3-example-addon" name="add-ons">}} is available on the web. Next, submit a pull request and our team will review it. If you have specific questions, use {{< link_new url="https://gitter.im/biolab/orange3" name="Gitter">}} for direct communication with the developers.

## I wish to commission a custom module and/or an add-on for Orange.
Please submit a contact request to discuss the idea and rates.
