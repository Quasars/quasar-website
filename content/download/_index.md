We will prepare the installers shortly. To use Quasar in the meantime, install it manually:

1. Download [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si/download/) for your operating system and install it.
2. Install the Spectroscopy add-on, as shown in this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4RBey-b2VA).

You are all set! To get started, see the [documentation](/docs/).
