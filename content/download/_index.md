Other platforms
===============

On other platforms, such as Linux, you will need a fairly recent python3 installation.
We highly recommend that you create a python virtual environment first. 
There, install Quasar with pip:

    pip install quasar
    
The above command will install all dependencies. Then, run Quasar with:

    python -m quasar
