Do you find Quasar useful and would like to contribute to the project? We are
always happy to form new connections.

Also, contact us if your are missing a specific component (visualization, file reader, 
preprocessing method, or similar) and are willing to commit resources towards
its development.

Please describe your proposal or issue as thoroughly as possible. If you are
proposing an addition to Quasar, please also mention a rough deadline and available resources.
